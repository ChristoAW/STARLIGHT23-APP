## ✨ Highlighted Feature — Division & Member Showcase

One of the core interactive sections of the site is the **Division & Member Showcase**, designed to visually represent each organizational division.

- Implemented a **card-based carousel** using Swiper.js for smooth navigation.
- Added custom “jump + flip” CSS animations triggered during page open and close to create a dynamic, tactile feel.
- Carefully synchronized animation timing with component state to avoid layout instability.

This section became one of the most visually distinctive parts of the site and reinforced the organization’s identity beyond static content.
